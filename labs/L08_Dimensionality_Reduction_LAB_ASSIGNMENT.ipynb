The first step in the discovery of a new drug is usually to identify and isolate the receptor to which it should bind, followed by testing many small molecules for their ability to bind to the target site. This leaves researchers with the task of determining what separates the active (binding) compounds from the inactive (non-binding) ones. Such a determination can then be used in the design of new compounds that not only bind, but also have all the other properties required for a drug (solubility, oral absorption, lack of side effects, appropriate duration of action, toxicity, etc.). The original data were modified for the purpose of the feature selection challenge. In particular, we added a number of distractor feature called 'probes' having no predictive power. The order of the features and patterns were randomized.\n","\n","DOROTHEA -- Positive ex. -- Negative ex. -- Total Training set -- 78 -- 722 -- 800 Validation set -- 34 -- 316 -- 350 Test set -- 78 -- 722 -- 800 All -- 190 -- 1760 -- 1950\n","\n","We mapped Active compounds to the target value +1 (positive examples) and Inactive compounds to the target value –1 (negative examples).\n","\n","Number of variables/features/attributes: Real: 50000 Probes: 50000 Total: 100000"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Si5QNHc0zu_Y"},"source":["### Train / Test Split"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"o2TwkJ1-jPcx"},"outputs":[],"source":["x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(\n","    X, y,\n","    train_size=.8,\n","    shuffle=True,\n","    random_state=RANDOM_SEED,\n","    stratify=y,\n",")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"AL-A1Ctxz56c"},"source":["### Performance Metric\n","\n","The goal of the dataset is to accurately determine whether a compound is \"active\".
